                The origins of Warsaw remain obscure. Excavations within present urban limits have confirmed the existence of Stare Bródno, a small trading settlement of the 10th and early 11th centuries CE. Its functions were taken over successively by Kamion (c. 1065) and Jazdow (first recorded in 1262). About the end of the 13th century, Jazdow was moved about two miles to the north, to a village named Warszowa (Warsaw), and the community was strengthened by the protection of a castle. From 1339, authority was invested in a bailiff and, from 1376, in a city council. By the end of the 14th century, the growing settlement had a double line of protective ramparts.</p>

              <div class="grid-item"><p>In the 15th century the town became the capital of the duchy of Mazovia, and the New Town sprang up to the north of the original, constricted site, afterward known as the Old Town. In 1526 both city and province became incorporated into the kingdom of Poland; from 1569 the Sejm met in Warsaw, and from 1573 the elections of the kings took place there. The first permanent bridge was built across the Vistula River in 1573, and in 1596 King Sigismund III Vasa began to remodel the castle as a royal residence. In 1611 the king and his court finally moved from Kraków (Cracow) to Warsaw, making it the capital of the Polish state. Powerful persons built residences in Warsaw,</p> </div>
           

           
              <div class="grid-item"><p>The development of manufacturing, banks, and other enterprises during the early 18th century provided a firm economic base for a number of early exercises in urban planning. During the reign (1764–95) of King Stanisław II August Poniatowski, Warsaw became the centre of the Polish Enlightenment. The first lay school (Szkoła Rycerska) was opened in 1765, and in 1773 the Committee on National Education began its activity in the city. The Polish theatre and numerous printing establishments also flourished. Warsaw played an important role in the striving for Polish political rebirth (following the first partition of Poland by Austria, Prussia, and Russia in 1772) when a parliamentary constitution was proclaimed in the city on May 3, 1791. The national insurrection of 1794, led by Tadeusz Kościuszko against the Russo-Prussian second partition, was brutally crushed; the ensuing third partition of Poland among Russia, Prussia, and Austria left Warsaw a provincial town of South Prussia. </div>
